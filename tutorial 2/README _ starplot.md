# Car Data Star Plot Visualization

An interactive D3.js star plot (radar chart) visualization encoding six car attributes.

## Six Encoded Attributes:
1. **Horsepower (HP)** - Engine power
2. **Retail Price ($)** - Car cost
3. **Engine Size (L)** - Engine displacement in liters
4. **City MPG** - City fuel efficiency
5. **Highway MPG** - Highway fuel efficiency
6. **Weight (lbs)** - Vehicle weight

## Features:
- **Interactive dropdown** to select different cars
- **Star plot visualization** showing all six attributes simultaneously
- **Grid circles** for reference (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- **Axis labels** for each attribute
- **Filled polygon** showing the car's profile
- **Data points** marked on each axis
- **Details panel** showing exact values

## How to Run:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Select different cars from the dropdown menu
3. Compare car profiles visually

## Insights:
- Sports cars show high horsepower but low MPG
- Economy cars have smaller engines and better fuel efficiency
- Luxury cars typically have higher prices and weights
- The star shape reveals the overall balance of attributes
